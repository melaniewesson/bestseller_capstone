# bestseller_capstone

The purpose of this project is to explore the relationship between book attributes and their longevity and frequency on the New York Times Bestseller list.  Specifically, this project aims to answer questions related to book genres, ratings, and format using data from the New York Times Bestseller API and web scraped data from Goodreads.  
To answer these questions, I will collect data from the New York Times Bestseller API and web scrape using selenium and beautifulsoup.  The New York Times Bestseller API provides information about books that have made it onto the bestseller list, including the title, author, format, and number of weeks on the list.  Goodreads provides book genres, ratings and reviews, which will be used to measure a book’s popularity and quality.
Overall, this project will provide insight into the factors that contribute to a book’s longevity on the bestseller list, which can be valuable information for authors, publishers, and other stakeholders in the book industry.
