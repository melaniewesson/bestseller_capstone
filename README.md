# bestseller_capstone

The purpose of this project is to explore the relationship between book attributes and their chances of making it onto the New York Times Bestseller list.  Specifically, this project aims to answer questions related to book genres, trends, ratings, and format using data from the New York Times Bestseller API and web scraped data from Goodreads.  
To answer these questions, I will collect data from the New York Times Bestseller API and web scrape the Goodreads list, “New York Times Bestseller List Books”, using selenium.  The New York Times Bestseller API provides information about books that have made it onto the bestseller list, including the title, author, format, and number of weeks on the list.  Goodreads provides book ratings and reviews, which will be used to measure a book’s popularity and quality.
Assumptions for this project include the accuracy of the data, as well as the representativeness of the sample of books on the bestseller list.  Challenges that may be encountered include missing or incomplete data, as well as the potential difficulty in establishing causality between book attributes and their performance on the bestseller list.
Overall, this project will provide insight into the factors that contribute to a book’s success on the bestseller list, which can be valuable information for authors, publishers, and other stakeholders in the book industry.
